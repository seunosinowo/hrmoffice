# Summary of Changes

## 1. Fixed Role Management

We've updated the role management system to ensure users only have one role, following the hierarchy:
- HR > Assessor > Employee

Changes were made to:
- `src/components/RoleBasedRoute.tsx`: Modified to use only the highest priority role
- `src/context/AuthContext.tsx`: Updated all role fetching functions to return only one role

## 2. Created SQL Scripts to Fix Database Issues

We've created two SQL scripts to fix issues with the database:
- `database/fix_rls_policies.sql`: Fixes RLS policies for the `user_role_assignments` table
- `database/fix_database_queries.sql`: Ensures all necessary tables and views exist with the correct structure

## 3. Created Deployment Instructions

We've created detailed instructions for deploying the application:
- `deployment-instructions.md`: Step-by-step guide for configuring Supabase CORS, fixing RLS policies, setting up Vercel environment variables, and redeploying the application

## 4. Created CORS Configuration Instructions

We've created instructions for configuring CORS in Supabase:
- `supabase-cors-instructions.md`: Step-by-step guide for adding your Vercel domain to the allowed origins in Supabase

## 5. Created Vercel Environment Variables Instructions

We've created instructions for setting up environment variables in Vercel:
- `vercel-env-instructions.md`: Step-by-step guide for configuring environment variables in Vercel

## Next Steps

1. Follow the deployment instructions to apply all the changes
2. Test the application to ensure the CORS issues are resolved
3. Verify that users only have one role assigned
4. Test the role hierarchy to ensure it works correctly
