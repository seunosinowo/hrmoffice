## Enabling Organization Sign Up and Login

By default, the organization sign up card/button and the organization-related links at the bottom of the sign up page are commented out in `src/pages/auth/SignUp.tsx` for individual user testing.

### How to Re-enable Organization Sign Up and Login

1. Open `src/pages/auth/SignUp.tsx` in your code editor.
2. Locate the commented sections marked as:
   - `/* Organization sign up card/button */`
   - `/* Organization links at the bottom */`
3. Uncomment the relevant code blocks to restore the organization sign up and login options.
4. Save the file and restart your development server if necessary.

### When to Uncomment
- Uncomment these sections when you want to allow users to sign up as an organization or access the organization login page.
- Keep them commented if you only want to test or allow individual user sign up.
