# SQL Error Fix Summary

## Issue

You encountered an error when running the SQL script:
```
ERROR: 42809: "user_roles" is not a view
```

This error occurs because the script is trying to create a view called `user_roles`, but there might already be a table with that name in your database.

## Fixes Implemented

1. **Created a New SQL Script**: `database/fix_user_roles_view.sql`
   - This script checks if `user_roles` is a table
   - If it is a table, it creates a different view called `user_role_view`
   - If it's not a table, it creates the `user_roles` view as planned

2. **Updated the RLS Policies Script**: Modified `database/fix_rls_policies.sql`
   - Added conditional logic to handle both cases (table or view)
   - Uses PL/pgSQL to check the table type before creating views

3. **Updated the AuthContext.tsx**: Modified the role fetching logic
   - Added fallback logic to try both `user_roles` and `user_role_view`
   - Improved error handling to gracefully handle either scenario
   - Ensures the application works regardless of which view exists

## How to Apply the Fix

1. Run the `database/fix_user_roles_view.sql` script in your Supabase SQL editor
2. Run the updated `database/fix_rls_policies.sql` script
3. Deploy the updated `AuthContext.tsx` file

## Explanation

The issue is that your Supabase database might have `user_roles` as a table rather than a view. Our fix handles both scenarios:

1. If `user_roles` is a table, we create a separate view called `user_role_view`
2. If `user_roles` is not a table, we create it as a view
3. The application code tries both views, so it works in either case

This approach ensures compatibility regardless of your current database structure, making the solution more robust.
